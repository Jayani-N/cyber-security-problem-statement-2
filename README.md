Step-by-Step Implementation of the code:

Step 1: Detecting rouge ap's using mac tethering,radio frequencies and signals
Step 2: Anamoly detection implementation with ML to identify unusual traffic patterns
Step 3: Detecting credential harvesting attacks, MITM, Ransomware, DOS & DDOS
Step 4: Dynamically adjusting the traffic threshold based on average traffic in previous intervals
